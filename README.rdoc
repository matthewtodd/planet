= Planet

This is my own installantion of Venus[http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/], live at http://planet.matthewtodd.org.

== Notes to Self

* Restore a robots.txt file, according to http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/docs/etiquette.html.
* Drop the HTML bits; write a simple theme that just imports common. Or can I just use common?
* Patch feedparser to continue including the xlink namespace.

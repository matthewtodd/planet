= Planet

This is my own installantion of Venus[http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/], live at http://planet.matthewtodd.org.

== Notes to Self

* Patch feedparser to continue including the xlink namespace.
* Must I include "lib/shell" in the PYTHONPATH? Why not just "lib"? (Want to clean up theme inclusion, too.)

= Planet

This is my own installantion of Venus[http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/], live at http://planet.matthewtodd.org.

== Notes to Self

* Set up logrotate.
* Use a different format for subscriptions.ini; though the HTML templates care, I don't like having to duplicate the "name" setting.
* Find a way to use the feed-level author for entries that lack author information.
* Restore a robots.txt file, according to http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/docs/etiquette.html.
